# Breakout session 1

- Use-cases for open-source data and metadata standards:
	- Where has the use of open-source standards benefitted your research?
	- How has a lack of open standards impacted your research?
	- What are examples of community influenced development of standards in your field?
	- How do you create open standards in your experience?

- Cross-sector interaction:
	- What are examples of cross-sector collaboration that have had an impact in your field?
	- What are the challenges related to developing standards when instrumentation is developed commercially? Discuss specific examples.
	- Who is responsible for sustaining standards (i.e., federal funders, research communities, industry, …), and should it be centralized?
	- How could the research community guide and influence industry standards to ensure they meet the needs of researchers?

-  Failure modes:
	- What are points of failure that have you seen in the development and use of open standards?
	- What are some lessons that have been learned from failures that you’ve encountered?
	- How do you know when it’s time to scrap the old and start a new standard?
